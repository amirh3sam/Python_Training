list : is like list in java  and is a collection size is dynamic and can be increase and decreased
The values in the list are
to create list by [] elements are ordered , changeable can be duplicated and can be of any data type

we can do forward or backward indexing
updating list: we need to giv the range of indexes of a specified range within the square bracket and define a list
with new elements then assigned them to the specified range
[start_index : end_index] = [list of new elements]

# we can convert list to tuple and tuple to list but not Dictionary because its collection of pairs!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when we looking for the two object referencing the same object
# THE REASON is the tuple is immutable just like the string when you have string literal the is only one objet memory
# located in the string pool since the tuple is immutable there is guaranty  the those element will not change so if
# you have two tuple object that has exact same contents gonna one objet will locate in python memory
# but list is changeable when you create list could be change later that is why even if they have exact same contents
# for each gonna be memory located

                                     List Comprehensions
 used to create new list based the values of and existing iterable

 new_list = [ var_name for var_name in iterable if condition]
                |__Must be same__|      |              |_________> Condition for filtering the elements of the iterable
                                        must be List/set/Tuple
