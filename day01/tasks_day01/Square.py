4. Create a python file named Square, write a program that can calculate the area & perimeter of any given square

        Hint: side need to be given to calculate the area and perimeter of square
            Ex:
                Given Data:
                    side = 5

                output:
                    Area of the square is equal to 25
                    Perimeter of square is equal to 20
"""

square = 5

area = square * square
perimeter = square * 4

# or you can do print(f"Area of the square is equal to {square * square}\nPerimeter of square is equal to {square * 4}")
print(f"Area of the square is equal to {area}\nPerimeter of square is equal to {perimeter}")
